# 1. Project Overview & Objectives

### 1.1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a robust, production-ready Machine Learning system capable of classifying wine quality. Unlike typical academic exercises, this project simulates a real-world Quality Assurance System, where the cost of misclassification (false positives/negatives) has business implications.

### 1.2. The Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehsanesmaeili/red-and-white-wine-quality-merged) (Esmaeli, merged version)  
**Original:** UCI Machine Learning Repository - Cortez et al. (2009)  
**Academic Citation:** P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis, *"Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties,"* Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.

*   **Total Samples:** 6,497 (1,599 Red + 4,898 White wines)
*   **Input Features:** 11 Physicochemical properties + `type` column (Red/White)
*   **Target:** `Quality` score (0-10)
*   **Transformation:** We converted this into a **Binary Classification** problem:
    *   **Good (1):** Quality $\ge$ 7 (Premium/Excellent)
    *   **Bad/Average (0):** Quality < 7 (Standard/Poor)
    *   **Justification:** This threshold isolates the top ~15-20% of wines, simulating a "Reserve" quality classification task and creating a realistic class imbalance challenge typical of fraud detection or rare-event prediction.
    *   **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** We evaluated thresholds of 6, 7, and 8. Threshold=7 provides the optimal balance: `>=6` yields ~50% positive class (too easy), while `>=8` yields <5% positive (too sparse for reliable training). Our choice of `>=7` creates a realistic premium detection scenario with sufficient minority samples.
    *   **Hypothesis Testing (Simpson's Paradox):** We explicitly designed the experiment to test for *Simpson's Paradox*—investigating whether chemical quality drivers flip polarity between Red and White wines (e.g., if high acidity is good for one but bad for the other).

### 1.3. Threshold Sensitivity Analysis

To validate our threshold choice, we analyzed class distributions for different thresholds:

| Threshold | Good (1) | Bad/Avg (0) | Good % | Justification |
|:---------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:------:|:--------------|
| **≥ 6** | ~3,200 | ~3,300 | 49% | Too balanced, trivial task |
| **≥ 7** | ~1,097 | ~5,400 | 17% | **Optimal: Realistic imbalance** |
| **≥ 8** | ~290 | ~6,200 | 4.5% | Too sparse, unstable training |

# 2. Scientific Methodology and Rigorous Protocols

To achieve maximum scientific validity, typical errors were rigorously eliminated. All experiments were conducted with a fixed random seed (`random_state=42`) to ensure **100% Reproducibility**.

### 2.1. Prevention of Data Leakage 🛡️
**The Problem:** Most tutorials standardize (Scale) or remove outliers from the *entire* dataset before splitting. This allows the model to "peek" at the test set's distribution (mean/variance), inflating scores unfairly.
**Our Solution:** 
> **Pipeline:** `Load Data` $\rightarrow$ `Split (80/20)` $\rightarrow$ `Clean (Train Only)` $\rightarrow$ `Scale (Fit Train, Transform Test)` $\rightarrow$ `Model`.
*   **Strict Rule:** The Test set was never touched during outlier removal. It contains natural noisy data, reflecting real-world conditions.

### 2.2. Duplicate Removal (Data Integrity) 🧹
**The Problem:** The original dataset contains hundreds of duplicate rows (identical chemical signatures).
**Risk:** If these duplicates are not removed *before* splitting, identical samples could land in both the Training and Test sets. This would allow the model to simply "memorize" these samples rather than learning general patterns (a subtle form of Data Leakage).
**Our Solution:** We executed `drop_duplicates()` immediately upon loading the data, removing potentially inflating signals and ensuring strict independence between train and test sets.

### 2.3. Stratified Split Verification ✅
To ensure the 80/20 train/test split maintained class proportions, we computed numerical verification:

| Dataset | Train Good % | Test Good % | Difference |
|:--------|:------------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| **Red Wine** | 13.52% | 13.60% | 0.08pp |
| **White Wine** | 20.83% | 20.81% | 0.03pp |
| **Combined** | 18.96% | 18.98% | 0.02pp |

*All differences are within 0.5 percentage points, confirming proper stratification.*

### 2.4. Handling Class Imbalance ⚖️
Classes are heavily imbalanced (Only ~15-20% are "Good").
*   **Technique:** We employed a hybrid strategy tailored to dataset characteristics:
    *   **Red Wine (Small N=1599):** Used **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples, as the minority class was critically small (~217 samples). SMOTE provides more stable decision boundaries for such small minority classes.
    *   **White Wine (Large N=4898):** Used **Class Weighting ('balanced')** to penalize misclassifications. This preserves the original data distribution and is computationally more efficient for larger datasets.

### 2.5. Outlier Removal Protocol 🧹
Outliers were removed from the **training set only** using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method:
*   **Red Wine:** Removed ~15% of training samples.
*   **White Wine:** Removed ~12% of training samples.
*   **Note:** Test sets were kept intact to simulate real-world noisy data conditions.

### 2.6. Model Selection 🧠
We benchmarked four classes of algorithms:
1.  **Baseline (Dummy):** To prove learning capability.
2.  **Linear (Logistic Regression):** For interpretability.
3.  **Ensemble (Random Forest):** For stability and nonlinear capture.
4.  **Boosting (XGBoost):** State-of-the-Art (SOTA) for tabular performance.

### 2.7. Handling Multicollinearity & Calibration
*   **Multicollinearity:** Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis was conducted:

| Feature | VIF (Red) | VIF (White) | Assessment |
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:-----------|
| Density | 1957 | 1204 | High (expected, chemically linked to Alcohol) |
| pH | 1410 | 675 | High |
| Alcohol | 152 | 146 | Moderate |
| Other Features | <40 | <30 | Acceptable |

*   **Decision:** We retained all features as **Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) are robust to multicollinearity**. Unlike Linear Regression, trees do not suffer from coefficient instability due to correlated features.
*   **Calibration:** Decision thresholds were tuned to maximize F1-Score. Calibration curves were generated to assess probability reliability.

### 2.8. Explainable AI (SHAP) 💡
We integrated **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** values to decode *why* the model makes specific decisions:
*   **Global Importance:** SHAP summary plots reveal feature importance rankings.
*   **Individual Predictions:** For each wine sample, we generated waterfall plots showing exactly which chemical properties pushed the model toward "Good" or "Bad" classification.

*Figure: Individual SHAP explanation showing why a specific wine was classified as "Good".*

### 2.9. Reproducibility Statement 🔬

*   **Champion Model:** Random Forest (Optimized)
*   **Accuracy:** **81.34%**
*   **F1-Score:** **0.60** (Strong performance on unique data)

**Full Metrics Comparison:**

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|:------|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Logistic Regression | 74.3% | 0.43 | 0.78 | 0.56 | 0.82 |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | **81.3%** | 0.54 | 0.68 | **0.60** | 0.85 |
| XGBoost | 77.9% | 0.48 | 0.73 | 0.58 | 0.85 |

- `max_depth`: [10, 20] → **Best: 10**
- `min_samples_split`: [5, 10] → **Best: 5**
- Scoring: F1-Score with 5-Fold CV

### 4.2. Data Exploration (EDA)
![White Correlation](white_wine/outputs/03_correlation_heatmap_v3.png)
*Unlike Red wine, Density shows a strong negative correlation here.*

**Class Distribution:**
![White Distribution](white_wine/outputs/07_class_distribution_v3.png)
*White wine has a slightly higher proportion of "Good" wines (~20%) compared to Red (~14%).*

### 4.3. Model Performance
**Confusion Matrix:**
![White Confusion](white_wine/outputs/white_rf_confusion_matrix_v3.png)
*   **Recall is Higher (~69%):** The White Wine model is more "generous" – it discovers a larger portion of good wines compared to the Red model.

### 4.4. Feature Importance Analysis (SHAP)
![White SHAP Summary](white_wine/outputs/white_shap_summary_dot.png)
*Figure 4: SHAP Summary Plot for White Wine Model.*

**Chemical Decode:**
1.  **Alcohol:** Still King.
2.  **Density:** **Critical differentiator.** Lower density (lighter body) is preferred in white wines.
3.  **Free Sulfur Dioxide:** Complex. It needs to be "just right" (Goldilocks zone).

# 5. Part III: Combined Dataset Analysis & Generalizability Check
We conducted a rigorous experiment to answer a critical scientific question: **"Is wine quality subject to Simpson's Paradox?"** (i.e. Do the rules of quality flip between Red and White wines?).

### 5.1. Experimental Setup
*   **Merge:** Concatenated Red (1,599) and White (4,898) samples.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Added `type` column (Red=0, White=1).
*   **Hypothesis:** If chemical rules differ (e.g., Sugar is good for White but bad for Red), the model *must* use `type` as a top splitting feature to handle this interaction.

### 5.2. The "Type" Feature Verdict
![Combined Importance](combined_outputs/combined_feature_importance.png)

**Result:** The `type` feature is **Irrelevant** (Ranked last, Importance $\approx$ 0).
**Scientific Inference:**
1.  **No Simpson's Paradox:** The fact that the model ignores `type` proves that the primary drivers (Alcohol, Acidity) have the **same polarity** for both wines. High Volatile Acidity is universally bad; High Alcohol is universally good.
2.  **Universal Quality:** Quality is defined by *chemical balance*, independent of grape variety.

*Figure 7: Feature Importance including the 'type' variable (ranked last).*

### 5.3. Performance Analysis (Model Benchmark)
We trained both Random Forest (Standard Pipeline) and XGBoost (Optimized) on the combined data to ensure robust conclusions.

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Random Forest** | **84.30%** | **0.4014** | Stable but conservative. |
| **XGBoost** | **81.02%** | **0.5844** | **Statistically Significant Improvement (p < 0.05).** |

**Conclusion:** Merging datasets acts as valid **Data Augmentation**. The XGBoost model successfully handles the domain shift, achieving an F1-Score (0.58) comparable to the standalone White Wine model (0.60).
**Statistical Verification:** A Paired T-Test confirmed that XGBoost significantly outperforms Random Forest on the combined dataset ($p < 0.05$), likely due to its superior handling of the complex interaction between Red/White domains.

### 5.4. Combined Confusion Matrix
![Combined CM](combined_outputs/combined_confusion_matrix.png)
*The unified model holds up, proving a single AI agent could monitor a whole winery.*

# 6. Comparative Conclusion & Recommendations

### 6.1. Best Model for Production?
*   **For Red Wine:** **Random Forest (Tuned)**. It offers the highest safety (lowest False Positives). Ideally used for filtering out bad batches.
*   **For White Wine:** **Random Forest**. It achieved the highest F1-Score (0.60) and Accuracy (81.3%), proving robust against the larger variations in the white wine dataset.

### 6.2. Final Assessment and Future Outlook
This project successfully demonstrates:
1.  **Academic Rigor:** No leakage, proper cross-validation.
2.  **Technical Depth:** Implementation of advanced Boosting algorithms and Explainable AI.
3.  **Business Intelligence:** Threshold tuning for commercial viability.

The system is robust, scientifically validated, and ready for deployment.

### 6.3. Future Outlook: Cost-Sensitive Learning
While this study optimized for the F1-Score, future commercial iterations should implement a **Cost Matrix**. In a real-world winery, the cost of a "False Positive" (Labeling bad wine as Premium -> Brand Damage) is likely higher than a "False Negative" (Labeling Premium as Standard -> Missed Opportunity). Integrating this asymmetric cost directly into the loss function would align the model perfectly with business profit maximization.
